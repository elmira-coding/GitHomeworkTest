My name is ELMIRA ZANGENEH,Walking is my popular sport because almost anyone can do it, regardless of age or fitness level.Also it can be a great way to connect with others, whether with friends, family, or in walking groups.
My favorite food is pasta It's relatively quick and easy to prepare, making it a convenient meal option.
I enjoy the music at this link: mjsMT9t8uNI?si=kLAYE1PpBjCau_t8. everytime I need some energy, it inspires me.
